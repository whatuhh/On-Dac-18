# On-Dac-18
Are you broke? Do you dream of owning a Behringer Wing or Presounus StudioLive 32SC? 
Do you just love the technical aspect of sound engineering but dont have the money? 
Do you wish you could just poof one into existance? 
Well if you do (Chnaces are you dont and you stumbled uppon this repository) let me introduce you into the ON-DAC-18 By Me!
# What?
The ON-DAC-18 or On-Board networking Digital Audio Console is a small form factor compliled together from off the shelf parts that any maker can poof into existance.
It can be pricy to make one running you about ??? dollars USD if your smart with your purchaces but compared to some off the shelf digital mixer with the same capabilitys thats a deal!
In a nutshell the ON-DAC-18 is a Behrigner XR18 connected to the same network as a Single Board Computer and a Behringer X-Touch.
The idea is mine how you execute it is yours bring your own controller or mixer or hell put a AMD thread ripper in there. Run DOOM! 
The niddy griddy of it will be explained in as much detail as a I posibly can.
# Some Details
The ON-DAC-18 is not just a mixing console, it aspires to be a full A.V.L. solution* with modular individual consoles for audio, video and lighting. 
Keeping the spirit of using off the shelf parts and in the style of MA Lighting Grand MA 2 and 3 it will have a touch screen with keys wraping around.
Moterized faders with remote control and integrated networking.
That last part is crutial for expansion, it will hav external RJ-45 or Ethercon connectors that can be connected to a other nodes that are like the ON-DAC 18 in design but serve like stated before video and lighting control.
Also a X32 Rack and maybe even Wing Rack version might come in the future, ideas are coming into my mind right now.
